## What is Une?

Une */juÀên/* is an **unfinished, unpolished, and *very* simple** interpreted programming language written in C as part of my Gymnasium Matura paper.

## What can Une do?

Une supports most basic language capabilities one expects from an interpreted programming language, but it doesn't go much further than that.
Some demo programs can be found in [examples](examples).

## How do I run Une?

1. Build the executable:

- Download this repository.
- Run `make.sh` from within the repository.  
  (Ensure `compiler` points to either GCC or Clang.)

2. Run a script:

```
une {<script>|-s <string>}
```

## Visual Studio Code Language Support

If you're using Visual Studio Code, make sure to install [the Une extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chnet.une) to get syntax highlighting and general language support. The repository for the extension can be found [here](https://github.com/thechnet/une-vscode).
