# Using an Abstract Syntax Tree
# While the previous approaches for lexing weren't bad, I had no idea how to parse the tokens.
# Turning to the internet for help, I found a video series by YouTuber 'CodePulse' (youtube.com/watch?v=Eythq9848Fg), showing an approach to create an Abstract Syntax Tree:
# - We first perform lexical analysis to create an array of tokens.
#   This is very similar to the ideas I've explored so far.
#   The only difference is that instead of moving to character index
#   in every loop, we only move it when we were able to properly
#   process the current character.
# - Next we build a syntax tree:
#   - We look at the first token, and from there decide what end object
#     we want to construct. In this first test we're only evaluating
#     arithmetic expressions, so we always know we want to construct
#     an expression.
#   - We construct objects by constructing their individual pieces,
#     which in turn will construct *their* individual pieces.
#     An arithmetic evaluation is built from individual terms, which in
#     turn are built from factors. Therefore, we get an expression by:
#     - constructing an expression by
#     - constructing a term by
#     - constructing a factor,
#     - returning the factor,
#     - returning the term,
#     - and finally, returning the expression.
# - Finally, we interpret the tree:
#   - We find out what action needs to be done by inspecting
#     the corresponding place in the data structure.
#     (e.g. the action in '1*1+1' would be add '1*1' and '1', however
#     in '1*(1+1)' it would be multiply '1' by '(1+1)'.)
#   - We execute this action by visiting all its children and executing
#     the actions they in turn require, until we have a final result, which
#     we then pass back up to the root action.

# This test is a first implementation of an arithmetic evaluator.
# It is heavily based on CodePulse's example.
# I recoded this program in test-6, focusing less on Python-specific
# language features and with an eventual C implementation in mind.
