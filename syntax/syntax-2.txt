This file shows that the syntax of a programming language really only consists of code blocks (either with or without conditions), control flow instructions (break), and expressions (either stored into a variable or not):


code block:

if X { }
for X { }
def X { }
{ }


control flow:

continue;
return;
break; // always terminates block


expression:

1
"str"
func()



A potential idea to simplify this structure further would be to only have 'if' blocks, where the logic to produce a 'for' loop (increment, continue, break) is done inside the code block.
